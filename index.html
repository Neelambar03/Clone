            <h2>About Nature</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
                Nature is an inherent character or constitution, particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a
                whole.
                In this general sense, nature refers to the laws, elements, and phenomena of the physical world,
                including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often
                described
                as at odds, or separate from nature.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the rise of the modern scientific method, nature was seen as passive and governed by divine laws.
                With the Industrial Revolution, nature was redefinedâ€”either sacred, or a background to human
                development.
                Thinkers like Rousseau and Darwin revived a vitalist view of nature.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, nature refers to living beings, inanimate processes like weather and geology, and the wilderness
                untouched by human alteration. It reflects a contrast between what is natural and what is artificial.
